#Overview

This project aims to analyze the trend and distribution of the approved budget and actual expenditure of the Toronto Police Service(TPS) by several types each year from 2016 to 2020. The dataset includes all individual entries annually from the report of the TPS.

The analysis focuses on the category and command of the approved budget and actual expenditure, evaluating the change in distribution of the budget among those types each year.

From the analysis, it is perceivable that the actual expenditure appeared to be lower than the budget during the whole period, while the salaries expense took up the largest proportion of the total spendings.
